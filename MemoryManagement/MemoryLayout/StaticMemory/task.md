Static memory contains all the global variables, 
as well as the program code itself. 
Static memory is allocated and initialized at the start of the program 
and is freed only upon program termination.  
Therefore, the memory in this region is available 
throughout the entire runtime of the program.

The program attached to this step defines two global variables 
and prints their addresses to the terminal. 
Run this program to see the addresses assigned to these variables.
