Next, let us discuss the memory layout of user-defined custom types: enums and structures.

Enums are internally represented simply as integers.
Consider the following declaration of an enum type:

```c++
enum Color {
    RED, GREEN, BLUE
};
```

Run the following code to make sure that 
the types `Color` and `int` occupy exactly the same amount of memory:

```c++
std::cout << sizeof(int) << "\n";
std::cout << sizeof(Color) << "\n";
```

The memory layout of structs is more complex, 
as it needs to account for not only the sizes 
of its components but also their __alignment__.

The [alignment](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/object#Alignment) 
of a type is the number of bytes between successive memory addresses 
at which variables of this type can be allocated.
The alignment of a type can be queried using the `alignof` operator,
which returns a value of type `size_t`.
For primitive predefined types, such as `int` or `double`, 
alignment typically equals the size of the type, 
but this is not always the case for all types.

```c++
std::cout << alignof(int) << "\n";
// prints 4 on most modern machines
std::cout << alignof(double) << "\n";
// prints 8 on most modern machines
```

<div class="hint">

The motivation for introducing the concept of 
[alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment)
in the C++ language stems from the low-level details 
of how processors typically operate on memory.
When writing or reading data of, say, 4 bytes to/from the memory,
the processor expects that the accessed memory address 
is a multiplier of 4, that it is _aligned_ to 4 bytes.
Otherwise, such memory access is called _unaligned_.
Depending on the concrete processor architecture,
unaligned memory accesses can be slower or even trigger an error.

The memory layout of custom structs takes into account the alignment of 
individual fields. If necessary, the compiler inserts _padding_ 
in order to properly align all members of the struct. 
Consider the following structure.

```c++
struct Foo {
    int x;
    char a;
    char b;
    int y;
};
```

Assuming `int` occupies 4 bytes, this struct has a size of 12 bytes and an alignment of 4 bytes.
This is because the compiler inserts 2 additional padding bytes between the fields `b` and `y`.

```c++
std::cout << sizeof(Foo) << "\n";
// prints 12
std::cout << alignof(Foo) << "\n";
// prints 4
```

That is, the internal memory representation of the struct `Foo` is 
equivalent to the memory representation of the following struct:

```c++
struct FooLayout {
    int x;
    char a;
    char b;
    char _padding[2];
    int y;
};
```

You can check it by printing its size and alignment.

```c++
// prints 12
std::cout << sizeof(FooLayout) << "\n";
// prints 4
std::cout << alignof(FooLayout) << "\n";
```

Due to alignment requirements, two structures 
that have the same set of fields but are declared in a different order
can have different sizes.

For example, consider the following struct named `Bar`:

```c++
struct Bar {
    int x;
    char a;
    int y;
    char b;
};
```

Unlike the struct `Foo`, it has a size of 16 bytes.

```c++
// prints 16
std::cout << sizeof(Bar) << "\n";
// prints 4
std::cout << alignof(Bar) << "\n";
```

Given a pointer to a structure, you can access its fields using the member access operator `->`.
Assuming `p` is the pointer to `Foo` (i.e., `p` has type `Foo*`),
the following expressions have the same meaning:

| Operator          | Notation |
|-------------------|----------|
| Member of struct  | `(*p).x` |
| Member of pointer | `p->x`   |


In order to access the fields of a struct, 
the compiler computes the offsets of each field. 
For example, in the structure `Bar`, the fields have the following offsets:
* `x` --- 0 bytes,
* `a` --- 4 bytes, 
* `y` --- 8 bytes,
* `b` --- 12 bytes.

You can verify these field offsets by 
printing the corresponding addresses of an allocated structure.

```c++
Bar bar;
std::cout << (void*) &bar << "\n";
std::cout << (void*) &(bar.x) << "\n";
std::cout << (void*) &(bar.a) << "\n";
std::cout << (void*) &(bar.y) << "\n";
std::cout << (void*) &(bar.b) << "\n";
```

Note the `(void*)` part â€“ it is the _C style type cast operator_.
We will talk about it later in this course.
Here, we need it in order to display variables of type `char*`
not as strings, but as memory addresses instead.

To access a field of a structure, it is sufficient to just 
add the offset of that field to the memory address of the structure.
A reliable and cross-platform way to get the offset of a field is by using the `offsetof` operator:

```c++
// p points to the beginning of memory occupied by bar 
char* p = (char*)&bar;
// now p points to memory occupied by y field of bar 
p += offsetof(struct Bar, y);
// convert it to pointer-to-int
int* pi = (int*) p;
// we can now assign a value into y field
* pi = 42;
// prints 42
std::cout << bar.y << "\n";
```
