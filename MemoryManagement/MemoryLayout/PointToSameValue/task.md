Implement the function `pointToSameValue`, which takes two pointers and
checks whether the values of the variables they point to are equal.

```c++
bool pointToSameValue(int* a, int* b);
```

Make sure you handle the case when one of the pointers is null.
If both pointers are null, the function should return `true`.
