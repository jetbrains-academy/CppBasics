In the following lessons, you will learn about one of 
the cornerstones of the C++ language â€“ memory management.
All the data used by a program, including all the variables and arrays, is stored in memory.
The ability to precisely control how memory is allocated and freed 
during the course of a program is one of the key features of the C++ language.
This feature allows C++ programmers to develop performance-critical software.
In the next few lessons, you will learn more about how memory is organized and how to manage its use. 
In particular, you will learn the following topics:

* Concepts of the size of a type and the address of a variable.
* Pointers and pointer arithmetic.
* Memory layout of the program: static, stack, and heap memory regions.
* Dynamic memory allocation and freeing.
* Various potential memory-related bugs and the ways to prevent them.
