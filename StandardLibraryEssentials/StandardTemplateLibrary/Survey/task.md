## Survey

Thank you for taking our C++ Basics course! We would really appreciate it if you could take a few minutes to answer our survey. 
Your feedback will help us improve this and next parts of the course and make them more relevant for future students. The survey is anonymous and should take no more than 5 minutes to complete.
If you have already completed the survey earlier, there is no need to do it again.
