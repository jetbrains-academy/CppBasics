title: C++Basics
language: English
summary: "The course is designed for beginners who want to learn the basics of the\
  \ C/C++ language. <br>\n<p> The main goal of the course is to introduce the C++\
  \ language, its philosophy of zero-cost abstractions; its distinctive features compared\
  \ to other languages, and, in particular, manual memory management, and its areas\
  \ of use, such as high-performance applications, graphics, and system programming.\
  \ After successfully completing this course, you will be able to read and write\
  \ C++ code and develop your own programs of medium complexity. </p>\n<p> During\
  \ this course, you will be developing a simple 2D arcade game. In this game, the\
  \ player controls a planet that moves through space, consuming smaller asteroids\
  \ and dodging black holes. With each new topic covered, you will improve the game\
  \ by implementing new functionality based on the concepts you have learned. In the\
  \ end, you will get a working game, which you can further modify as you like. </p>\n\
  <p> Some of the topics covered in the course are listed below. <ul> <li> Basic programming\
  \ primitives in C++. </li> <li> Manual memory management. </li> <li> Object-oriented\
  \ programming in C++. </li> <li> Template meta-programming and functional programming\
  \ features of C++. </li> <li> Overview of the standard library. </li> <li> Multi-file\
  \ projects and program compilation process overview. </li> </ul> </p>\n<p> The released\
  \ part of the course covers C++ basic programming primitives. Stay tuned for more\
  \ parts of our course coming soon! </p>\n<p> Before starting this course, check\
  \ the following requirements. <ol> <li> Your computer needs to have a stable internet\
  \ connection. </li> <li> <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\"> Git </a> version control\
  \ system needs to be installed on your computer. </li> <li> Make sure that the path\
  \ to the root folder of the course does not contain spaces, special characters,\
  \ or non-latin characters. </li> </ol> </p>\n<p> The course is integrated into the\
  \ <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\"> CLion IDE </a>, which has only a\
