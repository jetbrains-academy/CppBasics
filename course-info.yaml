summary: "The course is designed for beginners who want to learn the basics of the C/C++ language. <br>

<p>
The main goal of the course is to introduce the C++ language, its philosophy of zero-cost abstractions; 
its distinctive features compared to other languages, and, in particular, manual memory management, 
and its areas of use, such as high-performance applications, graphics, and system programming. 
After successfully completing this course, you will be able to read and write C++ code 
and develop your own programs of medium complexity. 
</p>

<p>
During this course, you will be developing a simple 2D arcade game. 
In this game, the player controls a planet that moves through space, consuming smaller asteroids and dodging black holes. 
With each new topic covered, you will improve the game by implementing new functionality based on the concepts you have learned. 
In the end, you will get a working game, which you can further modify as you like.
</p>

<p>
Some of the topics covered in the course are listed below.
<ul> 
  <li> Basic programming primitives in C++. </li> 
  <li> Manual memory management. </li> 
  <li> Object-oriented programming in C++. </li>
  <li> Template meta-programming and functional programming features of C++. </li>
  <li> Overview of the standard library. </li>
  <li> Multi-file projects and program compilation process overview. </li>
</ul>
</p>
