The next few lessons are dedicated to the important concept of _ownership_,
which defines the rules for managing the lifecycle of resources,
such as allocated memory blocks.
The concept of ownership is a crucial part of the modern C++ language, 
and mastering it is an important step towards writing safe C++ programs.

Here, we are going to cover the following topics related to ownership:

* Lifetime of objects.
* `new` and `delete` operators.
* Placement `new` operator.
* Ownership and move semantics.
* Smart pointers: `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, and `weak_ptr`.
* Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) idiom.
* Rule-of-five and copy-and-swap idiom.
