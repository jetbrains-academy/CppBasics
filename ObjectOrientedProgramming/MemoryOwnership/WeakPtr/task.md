In C++ memory ownership, 
[std::weak_ptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/weak_ptr) stands out as a tool 
for managing transient ownership without affecting the object's lifetime. 
While `std::shared_ptr` enables shared ownership, 
`std::weak_ptr` complements this by providing a non-intrusive, observer-like role. 
This pointer does not contribute to the object's reference count, 
allowing for the detection of the object state without extending its lifetime.

The main use case of `std::weak_ptr` is to break circular reference cycles,
which could otherwise lead to memory leaks.

Going back the chat example from the previous lesson,
suppose we want to extend the `Chat` class
and add the possibility of assigning a host to the chat. 

For this purpose, we might rework the `Chat` class as follows
(also see the `include/chat.hpp` file):

```c++
class Chat {
public:
    Chat(int id, std::string name, const std::shared_ptr<User>& owner)
        : id(id)
        , name(std::move(name))
        , host(owner)
    {};

    /* ... */
private:
    int id;
    std::string name;
    std::shared_ptr<User> host;
};
```

Also, now, instead of the `User` method `createNewChat`, 
we would declare a function with the same name:

```c++
std::shared_ptr<Chat> createNewChat(std::string name, const std::shared_ptr<User>& host);
```

This function should take the name of the chat to be created, 
as well as the shared pointer to the user who will become its host.

Now, suppose this function creates a shared pointer `chat`, 
pointing to a new `Chat` object, then assigns pointer `chat->host` to `host`,
and `host->chat` to `chat`.
This would result in a reference cycle.
As long as `chat` and `host` store shared pointers to each other,
both their reference counters cannot drop below `1`.
This means that the object will never be deallocated â€” 
in other words, we got a memory leak!  

In order to avoid this, we need to use `std::weak_ptr` to break the reference cycle.
In particular, the `host` field of the `Chat` object should be declared as a weak pointer.

Note that the method `getHost` of the `Chat` class should still return 
a shared pointer:

```c++
inline std::shared_ptr<User> getHost() const;
```

To achieve this, you need to use the `lock()` method of `std::weak_ptr`.
This method creates a new `std::shared_ptr` pointing to the same object 
as the given `std::weak_ptr`, if it still exists;
otherwise, it returns an empty `std::shared_ptr`.

To complete this lesson, please fix the implementation of 
the `Chat` class (see file `include/chat.hpp`)
by using `std::weak_ptr` instead of `std::shared_ptr` for the `host` field.
Also, provide an implementation for the `createNewChat` function 
(see file `task.cpp` ).
