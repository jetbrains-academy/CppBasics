Placement new is a special version of the new operator that allows you to construct an object in a pre-allocated memory region. This can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as reducing memory fragmentation and improving performance.

To use placement new, you first need to allocate a memory region of the appropriate size. Then, you can pass the memory region to placement new as the second argument. Placement new will then construct an object of the specified type in the memory region.

When you are done with the object, you must explicitly call the destructor, and then free the memory region. When working with arrays, you must call the destructor for each object in the array, and then free the memory region.

Here is an example of how to use placement new to construct an integer object in a pre-allocated memory region:

```cpp
#include <new>

int main() {
  // Allocate a memory region of the appropriate size.
  char buffer[sizeof(int)];

  // Construct an integer object in the memory region using placement new.
  int* p = new (buffer) int();

  // Assign a value to the object.
  *p = 42;

  // Print the value of the object.
  std::cout << *p << std::endl;

  // Delete the object.
  delete p;

  return 0;
}
```

Complete the function to create an array of already predefined `MyObject` class members, and delete  objects using placement new.
