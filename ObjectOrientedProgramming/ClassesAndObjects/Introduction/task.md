In the next few lessons, you will learn about the object-oriented programming paradigm
in the context of the C++ language. As you will see, this paradigm helps
to organize code into independent subcomponents, manage the complexity
of applications, and streamline the addition of new functionality.

We will reimplement our game using features of object-oriented programming.
This effort will help us to easily extend the game by adding new kinds of objects.
In particular, we will add enemy objects to make our little game a bit more challenging.
There is a lot of fun coming, so get ready for your journey into the world of objects!

Here is a list of specific topics that we'll be covering:

* Operator overloading
* Classes and objects
* Abstract classes and interfaces
* Constructors and destructors
* Inheritance and subtyping
* Subtype polymorphism
* Virtual methods
* Visibility modifiers: `public`, `protected`, and `private`
* Encapsulation and class invariants
* Static methods, fields, and variables
* Objects vs structures
