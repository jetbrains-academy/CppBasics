*The next four lessons will be dedicated to adding score and leaderboard functionality to the game. These lessons require knowledge of working with files and containers from the standard library, so we highly recommend that you complete both lessons from [Standard Library Essentials](course://StandardLibraryEssentials) module before proceeding.*

In previous lessons we focused on the implementation of basic mechanics. Now you will turn the project into a real game by adding a mandatory feature of any game â€“ a tangible goal (and, moreover, an ability to compete).

In the following lessons, you will add functionality of earning points in the game and climbing the leaderboard. It would be similar to old arcade games, where you could set your name on the top of the leaderboard if you're skilled enough!

Here is the list of the tasks you will need to complete in the following lessons:
* Adding score to the game
* Name input screen creation
* Data loading and saving
* Scene transitions
