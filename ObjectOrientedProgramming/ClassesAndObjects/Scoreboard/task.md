*The next four lessons will be dedicated to adding score and leaderboard functionality to the game. These lessons require knowledge of working with files and containers from the standard library, so we highly recommend completing both lessons from the [Standard Library Essentials](course://StandardLibraryEssentials) module before proceeding.*

In previous lessons, we focused on implementing basic mechanics. Now, you will turn the project into a real game by adding a crucial feature of any game â€“ a tangible goal, and more importantly, the ability to compete.

In the following lessons, you will add the functionality for earning points and climbing the leaderboard. It will be similar to old arcade games, where you could set your name at the top of the leaderboard if you were skilled enough!

Here is a list of the tasks you will need to complete in the following lessons:
* Adding score to the game
* Creating a name input screen
* Loading and saving data
* Implementing scene transitions
